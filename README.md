Project 2

[16,21,11,8,12,22] -> Merge Sort

1)Write the stages of the above array according to the sort type.

[16,21,11,8,12,22]----->[16,21,11]----[8,12,22]

[16,21,11]------> [16] [21,11]-->[11,21]

[16]-- [11,21]--> [11,16,21]

[8,12,22]----->[8] [12,22]--> [8,11,22]

[8] [12,22]--> [8,12,22]

[8,11,12,16,21,22]

2)Write down the Big-O notation.

O(n*(logn)) --> O(nlogn)
